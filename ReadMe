This Project intend to teach Exception handling on Python.

An exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. However, while
running a program, Python throws an exception that must be handled in order for your
application not to crash. Exceptions in Python are triggered automatically on errors, or
they can be created and intercepted by your code.
